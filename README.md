<h1>C-Letters_Frequency_Counter</h1>
<p>It is a program goes throw the letters of a file selected by the user, where our program counts the frequencies of the letters inside that file, our program represent the big capital
letters ex 'A' as a different data from the lower captal letters ex 'a'.</p>
<p>We can do the representaion of big captial letters 'A' and lower captial letters 'a' as the same data by doing : <br>
<pre>
if(c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z')
  ascii_letters[c - 32]++;
</pre>

so we store the occurance of the big capital letters and small capital letters as the same data.</p>
